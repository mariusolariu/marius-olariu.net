I was impressed by Marius' ability to handle parallel tasks like completing the study workload and picking development in a complex and big framework used inside our product. He managed very well to solve tasks requiring back-end technologies like SQL but also front-end tasks requiring him to master the framework used for the UI development. He proved his capability to handle difficult problems. As a team member or leader, Marius earns my highest recommendation."

As a Product Manager, I really appreciate his direct working style and willingness to gain a deep understanding of product/user needs from the perspective of a developer. He makes an effort to understand the 'why' and not only just the 'what'. Overall I appreciate that Marius took strong opinions about his work, was always willing to ask questions and learn, and ensured that he spend time in the most efficient way possible. He's also genuinely a nice person which made it easy to approach him for questions or to collaborate."
